      Whether the system is in a deprecated status.

      The system is usually set as deprecated as effect of managing some kind of devices, for
      example, when iSCSI sessions are created or when a zFCP disk is activated.

      A deprecated system means that the probed system could not match with the current system.

      It is expected that clients probe devices again if the system is deprecated.
